# AdmissionsConsultantProject


In this project, I analyzed The College of Woosterâ€™s dataset of prospects using R to find actionable insights that would help the Admissions Staff to refine their name-buying practices and associated outreach. I also used predictive modelling techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees and exploratory data analysis to suggest changes in outreach approach and diversifying the campus.
